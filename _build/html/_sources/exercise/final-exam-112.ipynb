    "- The final examination comprises **three** questions. Ensure to address all the questions by presenting your codes comprehensively and summarizing your solutions, outcomes, and analysis in a clear paragraph at the end of your answers for each question.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Everyone needs to work on the questions independently. You are NOT ALLOWED to discuss the questions with your peers. However, you are free to make use of any online resources, including LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All required datasets for the exam are accessible from [`demo_data/final`](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/5pwj1elzuvx5pti9wx3k4/AJxUrG8ZF3PmjFkkCln4sQg?rlkey=lyxbdegvsx5e9y45j2d52e6oh&dl=0).\n",

    "- Similar to previous assignments, download the current notebook as your answer sheet and submit both your **notebook** (`*.ipynb`) and the **HTML** output (`*.html`) via Moodle.\n",
