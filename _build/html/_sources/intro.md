# ENC2045 Computational Linguistics


## Introduction

Computational Linguistics (CL) is now a very active sub-discipline in applied linguistics. Its main focus is on the computational text analytics, which is essentially about leveraging computational tools, techniques, and algorithms to process and understand natural language data (in spoken or textual formats). Therefore, this course aims to introduce useful strategies and common workflows that have been widely adopted by data scientists to extract useful insights from natural language data. In this course, we will focus on textual data.


## Course Objectives

A selective collection of potential topics may include:

<i class="fa fa-check fa-1x" style="color:DarkTurquoise;margin-right:5px"></i> A Pipeline for Natural Language Processing

- Text Normalization

This course is extremely hands-on and will guide the students through classic examples of many task-oriented implementations via in-class theme-based tutorial sessions. The main coding language used in this course is Python . We will make extensive use of the language. It is assumed that you know or will quickly learn how to code in Python. In fact, this course assumes that every enrolled student has working knowledge of Python. (If you are not sure if you fulfill the prerequisite, please contact the instructor first.)


A test on Python Basics will be conducted on the second week of the class to ensure that every enrolled student fulfills the prerequisite. (To be more specific, you are assumed to have already had working knowledge of all the concepts included in the book, Lean Python: Learn Just Enough Python to Build Useful Tools). Those who fail on the Python basics test are NOT advised to take this course.


Please note that this course is designed specifically for linguistics majors in humanities. For computer science majors, please note that this course will not feature a thorough description of the mathematical operations behind the algorithms. We focus more on the practical implementation.


## Course Website

All the course materials will be available on the [course website ENC2045](https://alvinntnu.github.io/NTNU_ENC2045/). You may need a password to access the course materials/data. If you are an officially enrolled student, please ask the instructor for the passcode.

Please read the FAQ of the course website before course registration.
