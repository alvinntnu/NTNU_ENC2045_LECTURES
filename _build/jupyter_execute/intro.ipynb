    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Linguistics (CL) is now a very active sub-discipline in applied linguistics. Its main focus is on the computational text analytics, which is essentially about leveraging computational tools, techniques, and algorithms to process and understand natural language data (in spoken, textual, or even multimodal formats). Therefore, this course aims to introduce fundamental concepts, useful strategies and common workflows that have been widely adopted by data scientists to extract useful insights from natural language data. In this course, we will mainly focus on **textual** data.\n",
