NLP systems must be able to incorporate common knowledge and contextual information to accurately interpret and generate language.

Deep Learning models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformer models, have shown remarkable success in various NLP tasks due to their ability to learn hierarchical representations of text data. These models can automatically learn intricate patterns and dependencies in the data, making them highly effective for tasks such as language modeling, sequence-to-sequence generation, and contextual word embeddings.
