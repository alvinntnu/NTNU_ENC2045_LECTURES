    "## What is Langchain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Langchain is an open-source framework designed for developers working with AI. It facilitates the integration of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 with external sources of computation and data. Here's a breakdown of Langchain's key components and functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integration of Large Language Models (LLMs):\n",
    "  - Langchain allows developers to seamlessly connect LLMs such as GPT-4 to external data sources and computation platforms.\n",
    "  - This integration enables developers to leverage the vast knowledge and capabilities of LLMs in combination with their own data and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Addressing Specific Information Needs:\n",
    "  - While LLMs like GPT-4 possess extensive general knowledge, Langchain addresses the need for specific information from proprietary or domain-specific data sources.\n",
    "  - Developers can utilize Langchain to connect LLMs to their own datasets, including documents, PDF files, or proprietary databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic Data Referencing:\n",
    "  - Unlike traditional methods that involve pasting snippets of text into chat prompts, Langchain provides comprehensive ways to design prompt templates that interact with the LLMs.\n",
    "  - Developers can segment their data into smaller chunks and store them in a vector database as embeddings, enabling efficient referencing and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Components of Langchain:\n",
    "  - **LLM Wrappers:** Facilitate connection to LLMs like GPT-4.\n",
    "  - **Prompt Templates:** Dynamically generate prompts for LLMs based on user input.\n",
    "  - **Indexes:** Extract relevant information from datasets for LLM processing.\n",
    "  - **Chains:** Combine multiple components to build LLM applications following a specific task.\n",
    "  - **Agents:** Enable LLMs to interact with external APIs for additional functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pipeline for Language Model Applications:\n",
    "  - User input: Initial questions or queries from users.\n",
    "  - Language model interaction: Sending user input to the LLM for processing.\n",
    "  - Similarity search: Matching user queries with relevant data chunks in the vector database.\n",
    "  - Action or response: Providing answers or taking actions based on the combined information from the LLM and vector database.\n",
    "\n"

    "### Saving Environment Variables in a `.env` File:\n",
    "1. Create a new file in your project directory and name it `.env`. This file will store your environment variables.\n",
    "2. Add your environment variables to the `.env` file in the format `VARIABLE_NAME=variable_value`. For example:\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   pip install python-dotenv\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In your Python script, import the `dotenv` module:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Load the environment variables from the `.env` file using the `load_dotenv()` function. Place this line at the beginning of your script:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   load_dotenv()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Access the environment variables in your Python script using the `os.environ` dictionary. For example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import os\n",

    "   api_key = os.environ.get('API_KEY')\n",
    "   database_url = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')\n",

Its main focus is on the computational text analytics, which is essentially about leveraging computational tools, techniques, and algorithms to process and understand natural language data (in spoken, textual, or even multimodal formats). Therefore, this course aims to introduce fundamental concepts, useful strategies and common workflows that have been widely adopted by data scientists to extract useful insights from natural language data. In this course, we will mainly focus on textual data.\\n\\n\\nCourse Objectives#\\nA selective collection of potential topics may include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n A Pipeline for Natural Language Processing\\n\\nText Normalization\\nText Tokenization\\nParsing and Chunking\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Chinese Processing\\n\\nIssues for Chinese Language Processing (Word Segmentation)\\nDifferent word segmentation tools/packages\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Machine Learning Basics\\n\\nFeature Engineering and Text Vectorization\\nTraditional Machine Learning\\nClassification Models (Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Common Computational Tasks\\n\\nSentiment Analysis\\nTex Clustering and Topic Modeling\\nEmsemble Learning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Deep Learning NLP\\n\\nNeural Language Model\\nSequence Models (RNN, LSTM, GRU)\\nSequence-to-sequence Model\\nAttention-based Models\\nExplainable Artificial Intelligence and Computational Linguistics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Large Language Models\\n\\nGenerative AI\\nApplications of LLM (e.g., BERT, ChatGPT)\\nTransfer Learning and Fine-Tuning\\nPrompt Engineering\\nRetrieval-Augmentated Generation\\nMultimodal Data Processing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis course is extremely hands-on and will guide the students through classic examples of many task-oriented implementations via in-class theme-based tutorial sessions. The main coding language used in this course is Python.\\nIt is assumed that you know or will quickly learn how to code in Python . In fact, this course assumes that every enrolled student has considerable working knowledge of Python. (If you are not sure whether you fulfill the prerequisite, please contact the instructor first).\\nTo be more specific, you are assumed to have already had working knowledge of all the concepts included in the book, Lean Python: Learn Just Enough Python to Build Useful Tools. If the materials covered in the book are all very novel to you, I would strongly advise you not to take this course.\\nOn the other hand, please note that this course is designed specifically for linguistics majors in humanities. For computer science majors, this course will not feature a thorough description of the mathematical operations behind the algorithms. Nor will we focus on the most recent developments in the field of deep learning based NLP. We focus more on the fundamentals and their practical implementations.\\n\\n\\nCourse Website#\\nAll the course materials will be available on the course website ENC2045. You may need a password to access the course materials/data. If you are an officially enrolled student, please ask the instructor for the passcode.\\nWe will also have a Moodle course site for assignment submission.\\nPlease read the FAQ of the course website before course registration.\\n\\n\\n\\nReadings#\\n\\nMajor Readings#\\nThe course materials are mainly based on the following readings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommended Books#\\nAlso, there are many other useful reference books, which are listed as follows in terms of three categories:\\n\\nPython Basics [Gerrard, 2016]\\nData Analysis with Python [McKinney, 2012, Géron, 2023]\\nNatural Language Processing with Python [Sarkar, 2019, Bird et al., 2009, Vajjala et al., 2020, Perkins, 2014, Srinivasa-Desikan, 2018]\\nDeep Learning [Francois, 2017]\\nThe Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics (Second edition) [Mitkov, 2022]\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Resources#\\nIn addition to books, there are many wonderful on-line resources, esp.\\xa0professional blogs, providing useful tutorials and intuitive understanding of many complex ideas in NLP and AI development. Among them, here is a list of my favorites:\\n\\nToward Data Science\\nLeeMeng\\nDipanzan Sarkar’s articles\\nPython Graph Libraries\\nKGPTalkie NLP\\nJason Brownlee’s Blog: Machine Learning Mastery\\nJay Alammar’s Blog\\nChris McCormich’s Blog\\nGLUE: General Language Understanding Evaluation Benchmark\\nSuperGLUE\\n\\n\\n\\nYouTube Channels #\\n\\nChris McCormick AI\\nCorey Schafer\\nEdureka!\\nDeeplearning.ai\\nFree Code Camp\\nGiant Neural Network\\nTech with Tim\\nPyData\\nPython Programmer\\nKeith Galli\\nData Science Dojo\\nCalculus: Single Variable by Professor Robert Ghrist\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPython Setup#\\n\\nNotebooks#\\nIn this class, I will use Jupyter Notebook for code demonstrations and tutorials. It’s important for you to set up Python environments similarly.\\nPlease note that many alternative IDE applications also support jupyter notebooks files. Another great option for Python developers is Visual Studio Code.\\nIn this class, we will mainly use Jupyter notebook files (*.ipyrnb), including all your coding assignments. You can run these files either with the default Jupyter notebook from the terminal or with other third-party IDEs that support notebook files, such as Visual Studio Code. Additionally, running the course materials on Google Colab is recommended.\\n\\n\\nConda Environment#\\n\\nAttention\\nThe following installation codes are terminal codes.\\n\\n\\nWe assume that you have created and set up your python environment as follows:\\n\\nInstall the python with Anaconda.\\nCreate a conda environment named python-notes with python 3.9:\\nconda create --name python-notes python=3.9\\n\\n\\n\\nActivate the conda environment:\\nconda activate python-notes\\n\\n\\n\\nInstall Jupyter notebook in the newly created conda environment:\\npip install notebook\\n\\n\\n\\nInstall ipykernel package in the newly created conda enviornment:\\npip install ipykernel\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd this new conda environment to IPython kernel list:\\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name=python-notes\\n\\n\\n\\nRun the notebooks provided in the course materials in this newly created conda environment:\\njupyter notebook\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this course, we’ll use jupyter notebook for Python scripting, and all assignments must be submitted in this format. (Refer to the Jupyter Notebook installation documentation if needed).\\nYou’re expected to have set up a Conda virtual environment named python-notes for scripting and be able to run notebooks using this environment’s kernel in Jupyter.\\nAlternatively, you can run the notebooks directly in Google Colab, or download the .ipynb files to your hard drive or Google Drive for further modifications.\\n\\n\\nTip\\nIf you cannot find the conda environment kernal in your Jupyter Notebook. Please install the module ipykernel. For more details on how to use specific conda environments in Jupyter Notebook, please see this article.\\n\\n\\nSet your parameters!!\\nWhen you run the installation of the python modules and other packages in the terminal, please remember to change the arguments of the parameters when you follow the instructions provided online.\\nFor example, when you create the conda environment:\\nconda create --name XXX python=3.9\\n\\n\\nYou need to specify the conda environment name XXX on your own.\\nSimilarly, when you add the self-defined conda environment to the notebook kernel list:\\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name=XXX\\n\\n\\nYou need to specify the conda environment name XXX.\\n\\n\\nInstallation tips!\\nThere are several important things here:\\n\\nYou need to activate the conda environment (python-notes) in the terminal before installing the necessary modules.\\nYou need to add the kernel name with python -m ipykernel install --user --name=XXX within the conda enviroment as well (i.e., actviate the conda environment first).\\nIn summary, activate the Conda environment python-notes, install the ipykernel module, and add the python-notes kernel to the IPython kernel list.\\nAfter a few trial-and-errors, I think the best environment setting is that you only add the kernel name (conda environment) to ipykernel within the python-notes conda environment. Do not add the conda environment again in your base python environment.\\nMake sure to install jupyter in your Conda environment (python-notes) and run your notebook from this python-notes environment.\\nRule of thumb: Activate the newly created conda environment first!!\\nFor Windows users, it’s strongly advised to install python-related modules in Anaconda Prompt rather than cmd.\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes for Windows Users\\nBecause some of the Window’s users are suffering from the problem that the notebook cannot find the correct path of your python-notes environment. Could you please try the following?\\n\\nAttention\\nWe assume you run the following steps in Anaconda Powershell Prompt.\\n\\n\\nCreate the new conda environment, python-notes (if you have done this, ignore)\\n$ conda create --name python-notes python=3.9\\n\\n\\n\\nActivate the newly-created python-notes conda environment\\n$ conda activate python-notes\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin the python-notes environment, install the module ipykernel\\n$ conda install -c conda-forge ipykernel\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin the python-notes environment, install Jupyter notebook:\\nconda install -c conda-froge notebook\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd this new conda environment to IPython kernel list:\\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name=python-notes\\n\\n\\n\\nDeactivate the conda environment\\n$ conda deactivate\\n\\n\\n\\nInstall the module nb_conda_kernels in your Anaconda base python (This is crucial to the use of self-defined conda environments in notebook.)\\n$ conda install nb_conda_kernels\\n\\n\\n\\nThen check if the system detects your python-notes environment\\n$ python -m nb_conda_kernels list\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote\\nIdeally, you should see your python-notes popping up in the results like:\\nconda-env-python-notes-py    c:\\\\users\\\\alvinchen\\\\anaconda3\\\\envs\\\\python-notes\\\\share\\\\jupyter\\\\kernels\\\\python3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you see the new conda environment name, then it should work. Next, initiate your jupyter notebook\\n$ jupyter notebook\\n\\n\\n\\nNow you should be able to see you conda environment python-notes in your notebook, but the kernel name would be something like python [conda evn: python-notes].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModule Requirements#\\nNot all modules used in this course come with the default installation of the Python environment. Please remember to install these packages in use if you get a module-not-found type of errors.\\nThe following is a list of packages we will use (non-exhaustive):\\n\\nbeautifulsoup4\\nckip-transformers\\ngensim\\njieba\\njupyter\\njupyter-nbextensions-configurator\\nKeras\\nmatplotlib\\nnltk\\nnumpy\\npandas\\nscikit-learn\\nseaborn\\nspacy\\nscipy\\ntensorflow\\ntransformers\\n\\nPlease google these packages for more details on their installation.\\n\\n\\n\\nCoding Assignments Reminders#\\n\\nYou have to submit your assignments via Moodle.\\nPlease name your files in the following format: Assignment-X-NAME.ipynb and Assignment-X-NAME.html.\\nPlease always submit both the Jupyter notebook file and its HTML version.\\nOn the assignment due date, students will present their solutions to the exercises, with each presentation limited to 20-30 minutes.\\nThe class will be divided into small groups for these exercise/assignment presentations, with the group size determined by the final enrollment. (Each group is expected to make two presentations throughout the semester.)\\n\\n\\nAttention\\nUnless otherwise specified in class, all assignments will be due on the date/time given on Moodle. The due is usually a week after the topic is finished. Late work within 7 calendar days of the original due date will be accepted by the instructor at the instructor’s discretion. After that, no late work will be accepted.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnnotated Bibliography#\\n\\nFind a minimum of five articles published in the section of ArXiv in Computation and Language over the last five years and compile an annotated bibliography.\\nFor each source reference in the annotated bibliography, provide a succinct summary and evaluation.\\nThe annotations should offer a compact overview of the content, as well as assess the relevance and contributions of the study to a specific topic or field, along with its quality.\\nEach annotation should be concise yet critical, comprising no more than 250 words for each source. Your annotations should provide a comprehensive overview of the study’s contributions, enabling readers who haven’t read the paper to grasp its significance. Remember, plagiarism is strictly prohibited.\\nIt’s advisable to choose articles related to a specific topic. For inspiration on potential topics, please refer to Part 3 Language Processing Tasks and/or Part 4 NLP Applications in the Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics [Mitkov, 2022].\\nThe deadline for the annotated bibliography will be announced after the midterm exam.\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle Colab#\\n\\nThe course materials are being revised so that all the codes can be executed directly on Google Colab. Ideally, it is hoped that students do not have to go through the painful experience of installing python as their start of the NLP !\\nRight now, we can check the packages available on Google Colab with the following commands:\\n\\n\\n\\n## -------------------- ##\\n## Colab Only           ##\\n## -------------------- ##\\n\\n!pip list | wc\\n!pip list -v\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo execute the code provided in the course materials on Google Colab, you might have to install certain packages not present in the default Colab environment.\\nInstalling packages or modules in Google Colab is simple and can be accomplished using the !pip command, enabling you to execute shell commands directly within a Colab notebook.\\n\\n\\n\\n## -------------------- ##\\n## Colab Only           ##\\n## -------------------- ##\\n\\n! pip install requests_html\\n! pip install pytesseract\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe expect everyone to create a directory named ENC2045_demo_data at the root of their own Google Drive. All datasets intended for future tutorials should be downloaded and stored in this designated folder. This setup allows easy access to the datasets on Google Colab using the provided code snippet:\\n\\n\\n\\n## -------------------- ##\\n## Colab Only           ##\\n## -------------------- ##\\n\\nfrom google.colab import drive\\ndrive.mount(\\'/content/drive\\')\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce you’ve mounted Google Drive on Google Colab, the path to access the course materials will be: /content/drive/MyDrive/ENC2045_demo_data/.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Logistics#\\nPlease refer to Course Website ENC2045 for a tentative course schedule and the grading policies.\\n\\n\\nDisclaimer#\\nWhile I strive to cover the basics of computational linguistics to the best of my ability, please note that I am not an expert in Python. Therefore, there may be more advanced packages or more efficient algorithms available that can accomplish the tasks discussed in class. However, it is our intention that the fundamentals covered in this course will provide you with a solid foundation to delve into the latest advancements in the field.\\n\\n\\nReferences#\\n\\n\\n1\\nPaul Gerrard.
