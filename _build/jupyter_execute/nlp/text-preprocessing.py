# # Text Preprocessing

# ## Overview

# - Before real data analysis and mining, we usually need to preprocess the textual data into more easy-to-interpret formats.
# - This step is tedious but crucial and often involves a wide variety of techniques that convert raw text into well-defined sequences of linguistic components.

# ## Types of Preprocessing
# 
# - Text Normalization
#     - HTML tags
#     - Stemming
#     - Lemmatization
#     - Contractions
#     - Accented Characters
#     - Special Characters
#     - Redundant Whitespaces
#     - Stopwords
# - Text Tokenization
#     - words
#     - sentences
#     - other self-defined linguistic units
# - Text Enrichment
#     - POS Tagging
#     - Chunking
#     - Parsing

# :::{warning}
# These three preprocessing steps do NOT necessarily proceed in a serial fashion. The seqential ordering of these steps can be very crucial.
