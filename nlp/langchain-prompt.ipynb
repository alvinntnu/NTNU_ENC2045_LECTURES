    "- In LangChain, **prompt templates** are a structured, reusable, and dynamic way to interact with various language models ¹. They are text strings or templates that take inputs and produce a prompt for the language model. Prompt templates offer a versatile approach to language model interactions, from setting the context and defining instructions to dynamically adjusting the content based on user needs ¹. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt engineering** is the process of designing and optimizing prompts to achieve the desired output from a language model ². It involves creating prompts that are tailored to specific tasks and use cases, and fine-tuning them to improve the model's performance ². Prompt engineering can include rule-based prompts, data augmentation, and prompt tuning ². \n",

    "- **Prompt design** is the process of creating prompts that are clear, concise, and effective in conveying the desired information to the language model ³. It involves crafting high-quality prompts that provide clear instructions and contextual cues to the model ³.

Original Draft: ```This current study aims to investigate the prosodic properties of the speech genres (i.e., entertaining and informative) within Taiwan Mandarin YouTube content and the effectiveness of different feature modes on automatic speech genre classification models. We established a corpus consisting of 5049 utterances, each of which was an inter-pausal unit in speech. All the utterances were recorded with their corresponding transcripts, speech genres, four durational features (i.e., utterance duration, pause duration, speech rate, duration-based PVI), and three pitch-related features (i.e., f0 mean, f0 range, f0-based PVI). Based on the transcript of each utterance, we also utilized the naïve TF-IDF technique to acquire the textual features. An utterance-based analytical framework was adopted. First, we used the binary logistic model fitting on the seven proposed durational and pitch-related features to investigate which prosodic features can effectively characterize the entertaining and informative speech. Second, we built three types of automatic speech genre classification models—namely, prosody-mode, text-mode, and multimodal (prosody + text) models—to study the potentiality of prosodic features in speech genre classification and whether multimodal (prosody + text) features can further improve the performance of speech genre classification. \\nAccording to the results of our logistic model, six of the seven proposed prosodic features—utterance duration, dur-PVI, speech rate, f0 mean, f0 range, and f0-PVI—showed statistical significance in the logistic model. Our analysis suggested that in comparison to entertaining speech, informative speech tended to have longer utterance duration, slower speech rate, more isochoric rhythm, and more perceptible intonation at a lower pitch level. Additionally, we fed the seven proposed prosodic features into the prosody-mode and multimodal speech genre classification models. Our results showed that (1) the prosody-mode model attained 0.733 accuracy, showing the potentiality of prosodic features in speech genre classification; (2) the multimodal (prosody + text) model outperformed the other single-mode ones, amounting to 0.846 accuracy. We conclude that prosodic features can complement the absent or underrepresented information of textual features in speech genre classification and further improve the already high-performing text-mode classification results. The inherent multimodality of speech makes it necessary to include both prosodic and textual features in the task of speech genre classification. \\n    ```')]\n"
