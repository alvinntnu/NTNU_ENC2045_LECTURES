    "NLP, or Natural Language Processing, includes a diverse range of language-related tasks aimed at understanding and processing human language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some common NLP tasks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis\n",
    ": Determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toxicity classification\n",
    ": Identifying and categorizing offensive, hateful, or misleading content, including hate speech, defamation, fake news, and misinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine translation\n",
    ": Translating text from one language to another automatically using computational algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Named entity recognition\n",
    ": Identifying and categorizing named entities, such as people, organizations, and locations, mentioned in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spam detection\n",
    ": Automatically detecting and filtering out unwanted or unsolicited messages, such as email spam or social media spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grammatical error correction\n",
    ": Automatically identifying and correcting grammatical errors in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling\n",
    ": Extracting topics or themes from a collection of documents to discover underlying patterns or trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text generation\n",
    ": Generating text automatically, including autocomplete suggestions and conversational responses for chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text summarization\n",
    ": Condensing longer pieces of text into shorter summaries, either through extractive methods (selecting and combining key sentences) or abstractive methods (generating new sentences).\n",
    "\n",
    "Question answering\n",
    ": Automatically generating answers to questions posed in natural language based on a given context.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks form the foundation of NLP research and applications, with repositories like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) serving as valuable resources for datasets, codes, and research contributions in specific areas of NLP."
