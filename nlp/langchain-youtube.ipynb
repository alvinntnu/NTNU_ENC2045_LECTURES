A colleague said to me one time, \"They don\\'t pay me to like the kids. They pay me to teach a lesson. The kids should learn it. I should teach it, they should learn it, Case closed.\" Well, I said to her, \"You know, kids don\\'t learn\\nfrom people they don\\'t like.\" (Laughter) (Applause) She said, \"That\\'s just a bunch of hooey.\" And I said to her, \"Well, your year is going to be\\nlong and arduous, dear.\" Needless to say, it was. Some people think that you can either\\nhave it in you to build a relationship, or you don\\'t. I think Stephen Covey had the right idea. He said you ought to just\\nthrow in a few simple things, like seeking first to understand, as opposed to being understood. Simple things, like apologizing. You ever thought about that? Tell a kid you\\'re sorry, they\\'re in shock. (Laughter) I taught a lesson once on ratios. I\\'m not real good with math,', metadata={'source': 'SFnMTHhKdkw'}),\n",

(Laughter) Both my parents were educators, my maternal grandparents were educators, and for the past 40 years,\\nI've done the same thing. And so, needless to say, over those years I've had a chance\\nto look at education reform from a lot of perspectives. Some of those reforms have been good. Some of them have been not so good. And we know why kids drop out. We know why kids don't learn. It's either poverty, low attendance, negative peer influences... We know why. But one of the things\\nthat we never discuss or we rarely discuss is the value and importance\\nof human connection. Relationships. James Comer says\\nthat no significant learning can occur without\\na significant relationship. George Washington Carver says all learning is understanding relationships.

I deserve the education that I get here. I have things to do, people to impress, and places to go.\" And they said, \"Yeah!\" (Laughter) You say it long enough, it starts to be a part of you. (Applause) I gave a quiz, 20 questions. A student missed 18. I put a \"+2\" on his paper\\nand a big smiley face.

I wondered, \"How am I\\ngoing to take this group, in nine months, from where they are\\nto where they need to be? And it was difficult, it was awfully hard. How do I raise the self-esteem of a child and his academic achievement\\nat the same time? One year I came up with a bright idea. I told all my students, \"You were chosen to be in my class because I am the best teacher and you are the best students, they put us all together so we could show\\neverybody else how to do it.\" One of the students said, \"Really?\" (Laughter) I said, \"Really.

You won't like them all, and the tough ones show up for a reason. It's the connection.\\nIt's the relationships. So teachers become\\ngreat actors and great actresses, and we come to work\\nwhen we don't feel like it, and we're listening to policy\\nthat doesn't make sense, and we teach anyway. We teach anyway,\\nbecause that's what we do. Teaching and learning should bring joy.

The U.S. hopes to use these pauses to deliver more aid to Gaza, aiming to send up to 150 trucks daily, and possibly facilitate the release of hostages. The news coverage also mentions that President Biden had previously asked the Israeli Prime Minister for a longer pause, and he expressed frustration that the situation has taken longer than expected.
