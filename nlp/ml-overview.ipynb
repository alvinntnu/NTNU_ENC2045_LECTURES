    "Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before the learning process begins and determine the behavior of a machine learning algorithm. They are not learned from the data but are specified by the user. Hyperparameters control aspects of the learning process such as the complexity of the model, the learning rate, the regularization strength, and the number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common examples of hyperparameters in machine learning algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regularization parameter (C)** in Support Vector Machines (SVM): This hyperparameter controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the classification error. A larger value of C allows for more complex decision boundaries, potentially leading to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Learning rate (alpha)** in Gradient Descent: This hyperparameter determines the step size taken during each iteration of gradient descent. A smaller learning rate may lead to slower convergence but can help prevent overshooting the minimum, while a larger learning rate may speed up convergence but risk overshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Number of hidden layers and units** in Neural Networks: These hyperparameters define the architecture of the neural network, including the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer. The choice of these hyperparameters can significantly impact the model's capacity to learn complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Number of trees and maximum depth** in Random Forest: The number of trees and the maximum depth of each tree are hyperparameters that control the complexity of the ensemble model. Increasing the number of trees and maximum depth can lead to higher model complexity and potentially better performance, but may also increase computational cost and risk overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Number of neighbors (k)** in k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN): This hyperparameter specifies the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making predictions. A larger value of k leads to a smoother decision boundary but may reduce the model's ability to capture local patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of hyperparameters in common machine learning algorithms include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logistic Regression**:\n",
    "   - **Regularization parameter (C)**: Controls the strength of regularization, with larger values indicating weaker regularization.\n",
    "   - **Penalty**: Specifies the type of regularization (e.g., L1 or L2 regularization).\n",
    "   - **Solver**: Determines the optimization algorithm used to fit the logistic regression model (e.g., 'liblinear', 'lbfgs', 'newton-cg', 'sag', or 'saga').\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Naive Bayes**:\n",
    "   - **Smoothing parameter (alpha)**: Controls the degree of smoothing applied to the estimated probabilities of features.\n",
    "   - **Distribution assumption**: Specifies the distribution assumption for the features (e.g., Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes a Gaussian distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clustering (e.g., K-Means)**:\n",
    "   - **Number of clusters (k)**: Specifies the number of clusters to partition the data into.\n",
    "   - **Initialization method**: Determines how initial cluster centroids are selected (e.g., 'k-means++', 'random').\n",
    "   - **Maximum number of iterations**: Sets the maximum number of iterations for the algorithm to converge.\n",

    "4. **Topic Modeling (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA)**:\n",
    "   - **Number of topics**: Specifies the number of topics to be identified in the corpus.\n",

    "   - **Beta parameter**: Controls the distribution of words per topic.\n",
    "   - **Number of iterations**: Sets the number of iterations for the model to converge.\n",
