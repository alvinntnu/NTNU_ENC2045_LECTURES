# TA Instructions

## Alvin Chen

1. After we determine the sample files, please rename the notebook files as follows:
    - `Assignment-X-Y.ipynb`
    - `X`: the number of the assignment
    - `Y`: an index of the student sample
    - Please use numerals (no Roman numbers)
2. For each student sample notebook, please add one text chunk (i.e., a markdown cell) right below the heading to indicate the name of the student. In the markdown, please use level-2 heading for the student's name, as shown in this current document. (i.e., `## NAME`).
